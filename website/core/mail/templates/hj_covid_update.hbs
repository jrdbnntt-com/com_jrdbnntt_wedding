<p>Hi {{to_name}},</p>
<br><br>
<p>
    We are looking forward to celebrating with you on July 9, 2022! We wanted to communicate what we are doing to limit COVID-19 transmission, and how you can help us in this endeavor.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>What we are doing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We will be rapid testing everyone at their first wedding event.</li>
    <li>All vendors are vaccinated and will be masked.</li>
    <li>All guests are required to be fully vaccinated.</li>
    <li>Masks are not required, but encouraged based off personal preference.</li>
    <li>All wedding events are outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are eligible for a vaccine booster, <b>go get boosted!</b> Most people are eligible for a <i>free</i> booster if they have not been boosted in the past 4 months (
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html">info</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vaccines.gov/search/">schedule</a>
        )!
    </li>
    <li>If you are traveling far distances, <b>please wear masks in transit even when not required</b>. We encourage taking a COVID test before you travel.</li>
    <li>Avoid large crowds and exercise "better safe than sorry" leading up to the event.</li>
    <li>Stay home if you have any COVID-19 symptoms.</li>
    <li>Take the rapid test we will provide you at your first wedding event. If you test positive, please do not attend the event.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>
    Thankfully, you can acquire 8 tests right now -- for free! From any state, you can request them from the government at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">https://www.covid.gov/tests</a>
    . Those in Washington state can request more from the Department of Health at : https://sayyescovidhometest.org/.

    Thanks,<br>
