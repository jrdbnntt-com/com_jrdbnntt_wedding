        <h3><i>What about COVID?</i></h3>
        <p>
            We hope to have a night that everyone remembers, but not as a superspreader event. As hosts, we are taking
            all steps to ensure it is as safe as possible, including making it an entirely outdoor event.
            <br><br>
            <b>
                We are requiring all guests, including plus ones, to be fully vaccinated and to show proof of
                vaccination upon arrival.
            </b>
            <br><br>
            If resources permit, we will rapid-test all guests. If you are unable or unwilling to be tested or show
            proof of vaccination, we respectfully ask for you to not attend.
            <br><br>
            We are currently planning for a full event, but we reserve the right to downsize, reschedule, or cancel in
            response to the pandemic. Please follow your comfort level and perceptions of risk when choosing to attend.
            Masks will not be required, but encouraged as a personal choice.

        <h3><i>Can I change my RSVP?</i></h3>
        <p>
            You are able to make changes to RSVP, including adjusting your guests, until the RSVP
            deadline, {{ rsvp_deadline_date }}. To edit your RSVP, go <a href="{% url 'reservation/rsvp' %}">here</a>.
        </p>

    <div class="page-section">
        <a id="rsvp-plus-one"></a>
        <h3><i>Are plus ones allowed?</i></h3>
        <p>
            In most cases, yes. Each invite is allotted a set number of guests. See
            <a href="#rsvp-edit-guest-list">How do I change the guests in my RSVP?</a>
            below for instructions on how to modify your guests.

    <div class="page-section">
        <a id="rsvp-edit-guest-list"></a>
        <h3><i>How do I change the guests in my RSVP?</i></h3>
        <p>
            You can modify your guest list by <a href="{% url 'reservation/rsvp' %}">editing your RSVP</a> until the
            RSVP deadline, {{ rsvp_deadline_date }}. Once you are done making changes, click the "Save RSVP" button at
            the bottom of the page.
            <br><br>
            To add a guest to your RSVP, click the "Add another guest" button and enter the information for the new
            guest. If you do not see the "Add another guest" button, you have reached the maximum number of guests that
            your invite has been allotted.
            <br><br>
            To remove a guest from your reservation, click the "Remove Guest X" button underneath the guest that you
            would like to remove. You cannot remove the first guest in your reservation, but you can modify the name to
            make it refer someone else if you want to.
